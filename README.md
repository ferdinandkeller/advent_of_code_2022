# Advent of Code â€• 2022 edition

This repo contains my answers to the 2022 edition of [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

Not much to add except that I made it fully in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), and that I might use too many abstractions (I want to make the code as readable as possible).

If I'm correct, the `puzzle input` is different for everyone. If you want to use this code, you probably will have to adapt it to your own case.
